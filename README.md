## How To Use

This app allows users to create memes using images taken with their camera or stored in their photo album.

### Sent Memes Screen.
The first screen you see is the **Sent Memes** screen. You can switch between a table view and collections view using the tabs on the bottom of the screen. When you first run the app, these views will not contain any items.

From this screen, 2 actions are possible:
1. Click the `+` button in the top right to create a meme.
2. Click on a meme item in the Table or Collection View to see a full screen image of the meme. *Note: this option is only available after you have created one or more memes.*

### Create Meme Screen
On this screen you can create a new meme using the following instructions:
1. To select an image to base your meme on, click either the camera icon in the tab bar to take a picture, or click on Album to select an image from your photo album.
2. You can rotate your device to change the orientation of your meme between portrain or landscape.
3. Click on the text that says **TOP** to input the text you wish to be displayed at the top of your meme.
4. Click on the text that says **BOTTOM** to input the text you wish to be displayed at the bottom of your meme.
5. Click on the *share* icon in the top left of your screen.
6. Click *Save Image* to save the image to your photo album.
7. You will be redirected to the **Sent Memes** screen. Your newly created meme should be displayed in the table.
